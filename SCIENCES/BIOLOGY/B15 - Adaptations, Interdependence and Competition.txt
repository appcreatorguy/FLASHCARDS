«
Abiotic factors«Non-living factors that affect communities: 1. Light intensity 2. Temperature 3. Moisture levels 4. Soil pH and mineral content 5. Wind intensity and direction 6. Carbon dioxide levels - plants 7. Oxygen levels - aquatic animals
Animals compete for«1. Food 2. Mates - for reproduction 3. Territory
Aquatic«Lives in water
Behavioural adaptations«Changes in behaviour to help survive eg migration, tools, pack hunting.
Biotic factors«Living factors that affect communities: 1. Availability of food 2. New predators 3. New pathogens (microorganisms that cause disease) 4. One species outcompeting leading to numbers too low to breed.
Communities«Group of interdependent plants or animals living together
Ecosystem«A system that includes all living organisms (biotic) in an area as well as non-living (abiotic) factors
Energy source for ecosystems«The sun is the source of energy in all food webs. Plants use photosynthesis to convert light into chemical energy in glucose
Example animal adaptations«Camouflage to hide/hunt; big surface area increases heat loss; blubber reduces heat loss.
Example plant adaptations«Long roots collect water; small leaves reduce water loss; big leaves increase light captured.
Extremophiles«Organisms that live in very extreme environments such as high pressure/temperature/salt concentrations. Example: Bacteria in deep sea vents.
Food chain«A single path in a food web.
Functional adaptations«Biological processes such as reproduction or metabolism eg giving birth to lots of young; hibernation; a chameleon's adaptive camouflage.
Interdependence«Different species relying on each other for food, shelter, pollination, seed dispersal. Changes to one species affect the whole community
Line transect«A line along which you measure distribution of organisms.
Plants compete for«1. Light and space 2. Water 3. Mineral ions from soil
Quadrat«Randomly chosen small area (often 1m2). Used to estimate total numbers.
Structural adaptations«Physical features eg fur, beak shape, foot size, sharp claws, thick blubber, big leaves, long roots, camouflage.
Interpendence«The network of relationships between different organisms within an community
Distribution«when particular types of organisms are found within an environment
sample size«the size of a sample in an investigation
Quantitative sampling«records the numbers of organisms rather than just the type
mean«the arithmetic average of a distribution, obtained by adding the scores and then dividing by the number of scores
range«The maximum and minimum values for the independent or dependent
Mode«The value that occurs most frequently in a given data set.
Median«the middle score in a distribution; half the scores are above it and half are below it
transect«a measured line or area along which ecological measurements are made
abundace«A measure of how common or rare a particular type of organism is
competition«The process by witch living organisms compete with each other for limited resources
Adaptations«Changes in physical structure, function, or behaviour that allow an organism or species to survive and reproduce in a given environment.
predators«animals that kill and eat other animals
community«A group of interdependent organisms inhabiting the same region
light intensity«An abiotic factor that would specifically affect plants
oxygen levels«An abiotic factor that specifically affects sea creatures
territory«Animals compete for food, mates and..
minerals«Plants compete for light, water and..
camouflage«An adaptation specifically useful for predators and prey
water«Cacti store this in the stem to survive their conditions
random«To make it fair, sampling must be this
random number generator«A more accurate tool to ensure unbiased sampling points are chosen.
