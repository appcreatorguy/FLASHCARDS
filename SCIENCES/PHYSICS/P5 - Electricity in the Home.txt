AC or DC? Mains electricity in the uk;AC
what is AC;alternating current
what is DC;direct current
What is frequency?;number of waves per second
current that goes around in one direction at a constant voltage;direct current
alternating current;current that repeatedly reverses its direction and voltage
frequency and voltage of domestic electricity supply in UK;50Hz about 230V
what does the national grid do;supplies power from power station to homes/buildings
how are step-up transformers used in the national grid;increases size of the alternating p.d to reduce energy loss in transmission cables
how are step-down transformers used in the national grid;reduce p.d before electricity is supplied to homes
how are electrical appliances conected to the mains;using a 3 core cable
Purpose of the earth wire;As a safety feature, to ensure the appliance doesn't become live
What is the max PD in uk plugs;325V, this is equivalent to 230V in DC
what is the national grid;a system of cables and transformers linking power from stations to consumers
When electricity comes out of power stations what is the voltage;25,000V
What is the voltage used when moving electricity a long distance;132,000V
why is the national grid an efficient way to transfer energy;The National Grid transmits electricity at a low current to reduce heat loss, this is done using step-up transformers at power stations which produce the very high voltages needed
purpose of using an alternating current;You can use a transformer to change the p.d
Why is it best for electricity to travel at high voltages?;This will mean it has a lower current, which will reduce heat loss through the wires, making the process more efficient.
how are electrical appliances conected to the mains;using a 3 core cable
colour of live wire;brown
colour of neutral wire;blue
colour of earth wire;green and yellow stripes
purpose of live wire;carries alternating p.d from the supply
purpose of neutral wire;completes the circuit
purpose of earth wire;safety wire, stops appliance becoming live<br>if live wire touches metal case current flows to earth
p.d of earth wire;0V, only carries current if theres a fault, neutral wire is also at or close to 0V
Why should you never touch a live wire, even if the switch is off?;Your body is at 0V and if you touch the live wire, a large PD will act across your body causing a big current to flow through you.
what are the dangers of providing any connection between the live wire and earth;earth wire is connected to the metal case, connection between earth and live wire could lead to appliance becoming live
why are appliances with metal cases dangerous;The live wire may become loose and touch metal case, the appliance can then become live and if someone touched it they would be electrocuted
Why would you not need an earth wire in a plastic appliance?;Plastic is an insulator so wouldn't become live if it touched the live wire
function of cable grip;stops wires being pulled from plug
for an electrical appliance the current of the fuse must always be;slightly above the current flowing through it
What are the 2 safety features in plugs?;The earth wire<br>The fuse
Which metal is used in wires?;Copper
3 reasons copper is used in wires?;Fairly cheap<br>Good conductor<br>Easily bend
what are the pins made of in 3 pin plug and why;brass because it's a good conductor and doesn't rust or oxidise
short circuit;if a live wire inside the appliance touches a neutral wire, a very big current passes between the two wires at the point of contact. provided the fuse blows it cuts the current odd
equation for power in terms of energy transferred and time;power= energy transferred time<br>P= E/t
What unit is power measured in?;Watts (W)
What unit is charge measured in?;Coulombs
for any electrical appliance what is the current;charge flow per second
for any electrical appliance what is power;energy transferred to it per second
equation for power supplied in terms of p.d and current;power supplied= current x p.d<br>P= IV
equation for power in terms of current and resistance;Power = current^2resistance<br>P= I^2 R
What unit is resistance measured in?;Ohms (Î©)
Equation for charge flow in terms of current and time;charge flow = currentxtime<br>Q=It
Why does a resistor gain heat when charge flows through it?;The electrons passing through the resistor collide with the metal ions of the metal, so the ions gain kinetic energy and heat up
equation for energy transfer in terms of power and time;energy transfer = powerxtime<br>E=Pt
Equation linking energy transferred, potential difference and charge flow;Energy transferred = potential differencexcharge flow<br>E= VQ
what does the amount of of energy an appliance transfers depend on;how long it has been switched on and the power of the appliance
Why do many electrical appliances heat up when used?;The wires and resistors heat up due to the current passing though them
why do electrical appliances waste energy;because current in wire and component has a heating effect due to resistance
Equation linking power, current and potential difference;Power = currentxpotential difference<br>P= IV
Equation for efficiency;Efficiency = total useful output power /total input power *100
2 ways electrical appliances waste energy;Heat loss when the current passes through the wires and resistor<br>Heat loss through friction if there are any moving parts
