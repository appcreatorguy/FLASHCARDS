What can energy be transferred by?;Heat or by doing work
What will you need to investigate specific heat capacity?;- A power supply<br>- Ammeter<br>- Block of material<br>- Insulation<br>- Thermometer<br>- Heater
What can't energy be?;Created or destroyed
What can be done with energy?;It can be transferred usefully, stored or dissipated
What is the proper word for wasted energy?;Dissipated energy
What does lubrication do?;It reduces frictional forces
How can heating occur with energy?;By conduction or convection
What does insulation do?;It reduces the rate of energy transfer by heating
Does energy often get wasted during transfers?;Yes
Is useful energy input usually equal to total energy output?;No
What are 3 non-renewable energy resources?;1. Coal<br>2. Oil<br>3. (Natural) gas
What are the 7 renewable energy resources that will never run out?;1. The sun<br>2. Wind<br>3. Water waves<br>4. Hydro-electricity<br>5. Bio-fuel<br>6. Tides<br>7. Geothermal
Can energy resources be used for transport and heating?;Yes
How is energy generated from wind power?;By lots of wind turbines
What do solar cells get energy from?;The sun
What's geothermal power from?;Underground thermal energy stores, like in volcanic areas
What does hydro-electric power use?;Falling water
How does wave power work?;Lots of little turbines located around the coast
What do tidal barrages use?;The sun and moons gravity, they're big dams built across river estuaries with turbines in them so as the tide rises, it fills the estuary up
What are biofuels made from?;Plants and waste
What environmental problems do non-renewable resources cause?;They release carbon dioxide into the environment and add to the greenhouse effect, contributing to global warming
What is the use of renewable resources limited by?;Reliability, money and politics
