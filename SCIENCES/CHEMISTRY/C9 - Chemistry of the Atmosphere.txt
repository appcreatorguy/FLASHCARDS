«
Approximately how old is the Earth?«4.5 billion years old
Carbon particulates (soot) are formed during what type of combustion?«Incomplete combustion
Does respiration release or consume carbon dioxide?«Release
For how long have the proportion of gases been roughly the same in our atmosphere?«Approx 200 million years
Give one use of ammonia«Fertilizers
Give one use of oxygen«In hospitals during operations
How can we compare CO2 levels now to those over 150,000 years ago?«From air trapped in antarctic ice (ice cores)
How has the level of CO2 changed in the atmosphere changes in the last 50 yeas?«Increased from 0.03% to 0.04%
How many oxygen atoms make up one molecule of ozone?«3
How might coastal flooding be linked to global warming?«Sea ice melts raising sea level
Levels of Carbon Dioxide dropped by being locked up in what?«Fossil fuels
Name 2 gases each which make up less than 1% of the air?«Carbon dioxide and argon
Name the effect caused by some gases letting heat in but not letting it out again?«Greenhouse effect
Name the gas which makes up 20% of the air?«Oxygen
State one human source of methane gas.«Landfill sites or farming
State three human sources of carbon dioxide gas, excluding respiration«Electricity power stations, engines, central heating
The photosynthesis of algae released some of which gas?«Oxygen
The volcanic activity of the early Earth produced large quantities of which two gases?«Carbon dioxide and water vapour
What does ozone filter out?«Harmful UV rays
What force stops the atmosphere escaping into space?«Gravity
What gas can sulfur impurities in fuel form?«Sulfur dioxide
What impurity do most fuels contain?«Sulfur
What is global warming?«The increase of the Earth's temperature as a result of the greenhouse effect
What is the chemical formula for methane?«CH₄
What is the greenhouse effect?«Greenhouse gases absorbing infrared radiation
What is the percentage of Nitrogen in our atmosphere«78%
What issue can carbon particulates cause?«Global dimming
What issue can sulfur dioxide cause?«Acid rain
What issues can oxides and nitrogen and sulfur dioxide cause?«Respiratory problems in humans and acid rain
What two elements do most fuels contain?«Carbon and hydrogen
What type of combustion leads to the production of carbon monoxide?«Incomplete combustion
What were the first living organisms to evolve on Earth?«Algae (2.7mil years ago)
Which greenhouse gas is produced when fuels undergo complete combustion?«Carbon dioxide
Which poisonous gas is produced during incomplete combustion?«Carbon monoxide
Why do nitrogen oxides form in car engines?«At high temperatures in the engine nitrogen and oxygen from the air react
Why have levels of CO2 risen over the last 100 years?«Burning fossil fuels, deforestation
Why is carbon monoxide dangerous?«It is a toxic gas that is colorless and odorless so it is not easy to detect
Why is evidence for early atmosphere limited?«Because of the time scale of 4.6 billion years
what is considered to have lowered the CO2 content in the atmosphere?«when oceans were formed, CO2 dissolved in the water and carbonates were precipitated producing sediments
How was coal formed?«trees in dense low lying wetland areas were buried via fossils which prevented oxidation taking place<br>heating compression over millions of years turned the wood into coal
How was crude oil and natural gas formed?«1. Plankton and ancient biomass were deposited in muds on the sea floor<br>2. They were covered and compressed over millions of years to form crude oil and natural gas<br>- the lack of oxygen prevented oxidation from occurring
where is natural gas usually found?«on top of crude oil, trapped under sedimentary rock
give four examples of how human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere«- farming cattle<br>- farming rice in paddy fields releases methane<br>- burning fossil fuels in vehicles and power stations releases CO2<br>- deforestation releases CO2 and reduces the absorption of CO2 via photosynthesis
what are four effects of global warming?«- rising sea levels<br>- glaciers and polar ice melting<br>- patterns of rainfall changing, increasing droughts in some areas and floods in others<br>- habitats changing, changing biodiversity in areas and causing extinction for some species
